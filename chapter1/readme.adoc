== Build and Test Application using Maven

We will use a simple Java application built using Spring Boot. The application publishes a REST endpoint that can be invoked at `http://{host}:{port}/hello`.

The source code is in the `app` directory.

. Show the application code in IntelliJ
.. Show `GreetingController` class
.. Explain that the code can be more complex
.. Show `pom.xml`
. Run application:

	cd app
	mvn spring-boot:run

. Test application

	curl http://localhost:8080/hello
